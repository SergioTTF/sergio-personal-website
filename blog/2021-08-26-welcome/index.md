Hi there, my name is Sergio and I'm a Brazilian software engineer.

I became interested in programming and computers when I grew up playing video games and always wondered how all that fascinating technology worked. In college, I chose the Computer Science major and was introduced to Java.

Since then, I've learned a lot and built several software applications. My main career is as a Backend Engineer and I occasionally code some personal projects. My passion with programming is driven by the positive impact that technology can have in our daily lives, from saving time to saving lives.

## What to expect?

In this blog, I intend to write mostly about programming and technology, but occasionally I will write about other interests such as personal development, productivity, mental health, and book reviews. The frequency will vary, probably about one post every three months.

That's all! I appreciate taking your time to read my blog and see you in the next post!
